# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program
## Listed here are a number of the notebooks of Isaac's projects for the Nanodegree

Projects here were completed in Python 2.7 as part of Udacity's 6-month, project-based curriculum in supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and deep learning techniques (minus data and supporting files, for brevity). 

The 'Capstone.ipynb' notebook is part of the final, self-created project. I explored the use of supervised learning to help evaluate cluster validity on ~ 30,000 geo codes in France. The project proposal I created can be seen in 'proposal.pdf' and the writeup of the 18-page report can be seen in 'report.pdf'.

Additional files for the capstone are in the capstone folder, which does contain the datasets used as well as a scratch notebook with earlier work on the capstone.
